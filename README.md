Distractions for Eyes
======================

A Doctor said that our eyes are deteriorating because we are looking at our LCD screens for too long...
E-Ink displays are still not ready unfortunely...

He suggested the 20-20 : After looking at the screen for 20 minutes, look elsewhere (your cat for example) for 20 seconds.

This is where this program comes in !
Put this as an autostart application and it will show a green screen every 15 minutes, telling you to stop looking at it.

This uses SDL2 for graphics and a stripped down version of Gameblabla's Wrapper.
